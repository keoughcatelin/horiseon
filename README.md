Changes Made
I have made several changes to the original code:

Replaced <div> with <nav> and <header> elements to enhance semantic structure.
Changed <div class="hero"> to <figure class="content"> to provide a more descriptive element.
Replaced the usage of <div> elements in the main content with <section> elements to improve semantic structure.
Added unique IDs to the <section> elements to enable linking to specific sections of the page.
Changed <div class="benefits"> to <aside class="benefits"> and <div class="benefit-*"> to <figure class="benefit-*"> for improved semantic structure.
Replaced the usage of <div> with <footer> for the footer section.
